# 📊 AWS SaaS Sales Analysis (Excel Dashboard) 

Here is the analysis of an AWS SaaS Sales dataset done through Excel from start to finish. Initially we did data cleaning which was the most important step, erasing empty cells, unifying fields, and then we transformed the dataset into an Excel Table to have a cleaner structure and to be able to apply automation easily. Subsequently several pivot tables, and pivot charts were created to investigate various sales metrics. The interactive Sales Overview Dashboard with KPIs and slicers was the final destination where all the insights were presented in a tidy and user-friendly way.
